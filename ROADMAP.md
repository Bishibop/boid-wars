- Understand optimization needs

---

## Iteration 3: Scale the Players

**Goal**: Validate multiplayer at target scale

### Features
- 8-16 players
- Boid count from Iteration 2
- Basic matchmaking
- Proper interest management
- Deploy to production

### Technical Goals
- Optimize network traffic
- Implement proper culling
- Add interpolation/extrapolation
- Basic deployment automation

### Success Criteria
- Stable with 8+ players
- <150ms latency tolerance
- Successful play sessions

---

## Iteration 4: Enhance Gameplay

**Goal**: Add depth and polish

### Features
- Multiple boid behaviors (flee, patrol, swarm)
- Temporary alliance system
- Single-player mode
- UI/UX polish
- Sound effects

### Technical Goals
- Behavior tree for AI
- Alliance state management
- Game mode abstraction
- Asset pipeline

### Success Criteria
- Players engage with alliances
- Varied gameplay emerges
- "One more game" feeling

---

## Future Iterations

### Iteration 5: Platform Expansion
- WebRTC fallback for Safari
- Mobile touch controls
- Multiple deployment regions

### Iteration 6: Content & Features
- Co-op mode
- Special boid types
- Power-ups
- Progression system

### Iteration 7: Scale to 64
- Push player count
- Advanced optimization
- Multiple server regions
- Tournament mode

## Development Principles

1. **Ship each iteration** - Each phase should be playable
2. **Measure everything** - Data drives decisions
3. **Fun first** - If it's not fun at small scale, scale won't help
4. **Technical honesty** - If we hit limits, we adapt

## Current Status

ðŸŽ¯ **We are here**: Iteration 0 - Partially Complete

### Completed âœ…
- Basic server game loop with 1 player and 1 boid
- WASM client with canvas rendering  
- WASD movement controls
- Boid AI that follows players
- Game state visualization
- Build pipeline for WASM

### Blocked ðŸ”´
- **Lightyear 0.21 API Breaking Changes**: The networking library API changed significantly
  - `ServerPlugin` â†’ `ServerPlugins` (usage unclear)
  - Component registration methods don't exist
  - No working examples found for v0.21
  - **Workaround**: Running without networking (offline mode)
- **SSL/WebTransport Issues**: 
  - Certificates not configured
  - **Workaround**: Disabled HTTPS

### Technical Debt
1. **protocol.rs** - Networking code commented out
2. **No multiplayer** - Just local simulation 
3. **No entity replication** - Components defined but not networked
4. **Connection handling stubbed** - Events defined but not processed

### Recovery Instructions
If continuing from this point:

1. **Current Working State**:
   - Server: `cargo run -p boid-wars-server`
   - Client: `cd client && npm run dev`
   - Game works in offline mode with WASD controls

2. **To Enable Networking**:
   - Research Lightyear 0.21 examples in `lightyear/examples/simple_box`
   - Generate SSL certs: `cd deploy && mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1`
   - Fix component registration in `shared/src/protocol.rs`
   - Re-enable connection handling in `server/src/main.rs`

3. **Key Problem Areas**:
   - `/shared/src/protocol.rs` - Component registration commented out
   - `/server/src/main.rs` - Connection handling disabled
   - `/docs/technical/LIGHTYEAR_0.21_API.md` - Research notes on API changes

### Recent Progress âœ…
- **ServerPlugins API discovered**: Now using `ServerPlugins { tick_duration: Duration::from_secs_f64(1.0 / 30.0) }`
- **Server compiles and runs**: Basic server with ServerPlugins working
- **SSL certificates generated**: Using mkcert for localhost development
- **HTTPS enabled**: Client dev server running with SSL
- **Server entity spawned**: Successfully spawning Server entity in startup
- **Event system investigated**: Found Connect/Disconnect events but they're not initialized

### Current Blockers ðŸ”´
- **Connection events not initialized**: Connect/Disconnect/LinkStart/Unlink events cause "Event not initialized" panic
- **Component registration**: Still need to enable proper component registration
- **Server listening**: Server entity spawned but unclear if it's actually listening for connections

### Next Steps:
1. **Find connection events**: Search for correct event types in Lightyear 0.21
2. **Enable server listening**: Figure out how to start accepting connections
3. **Fix component registration**: Update protocol.rs with working API
4. **Generate SSL certificates**: `cd deploy && mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1`
5. **Test networking**: Connect client to server
6. **Implement shooting mechanics**
7. **Deploy to Fly.io**
