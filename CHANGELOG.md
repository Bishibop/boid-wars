## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Comprehensive WebTransport development guide documenting certificate challenges and solutions
- WebSocket fallback for local development to avoid certificate issues
- Bevy WASM client implementation as the primary architecture
- Performance diagnostics and monitoring in Bevy client
- Unified Rust codebase for both client and server

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Migrated from TypeScript/Pixi.js client to full Bevy WASM client
- **BREAKING**: Downgraded from Lightyear 0.21 to 0.20 for better WASM compatibility
- Updated architecture to use single technology stack (Rust/Bevy)
- Switched local development to WebSocket to avoid WebTransport certificate issues
- Reorganized documentation structure for clarity

### Fixed
- WASM borrow checker violations in Lightyear integration
- AuthorityChange resource initialization issues
- WebTransport certificate validation blocking local development
- Build times reduced from 5+ minutes to 30 seconds with incremental compilation

### Removed
- TypeScript client implementation (moved to legacy)
- Thin WASM bridge approach (moved to legacy)
- Dependency on Node.js for client development

## [0.2.0] - 2025-01-16

### Architecture Migration
This release represents a major architectural shift from a TypeScript/Pixi.js client with WASM bridge to a full Bevy WASM client. This change was necessitated by technical blockers in the WASM bridge approach with Lightyear 0.20.

### Technical Details
- **Client Architecture**: TypeScript + Pixi.js â†’ Rust + Bevy WASM
- **Bundle Size**: Increased from ~500KB target to ~3.5MB (acceptable for game)
- **Performance Target**: Maintained 10,000+ entities at 60 FPS
- **Networking**: WebTransport (production) with WebSocket fallback (development)

## [0.1.0] - 2024-12-15

### Initial Release
- Basic multiplayer infrastructure with Lightyear 0.21
- TypeScript client with Pixi.js rendering
- Thin WASM bridge for networking
- WebTransport protocol implementation
- Basic boid simulation (proof of concept)
- Fly.io deployment configuration

### Known Issues
- WebTransport requires complex certificate setup for local development
- WASM bridge has borrow checker issues with Lightyear
- Limited to ~1000 entities due to bridge overhead
