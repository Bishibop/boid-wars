# Position Drift Fix Summary

## The Problem

We were seeing massive position drift (400+ units) between physics Transform and network Position components:
```
Position drift detected on entity 41v1#4294967337: 437.283 units (physics: Vec2(200.0, 160.0), network: Vec2(415.0446, 540.7527))
```

## Root Cause

1. **Boids were updating Position directly** in `move_boids()` instead of updating Transform
2. **No initial sync** - When entities spawned, Position and Transform weren't synchronized
3. **Conflicting movement systems** - Both `move_players` and physics were trying to control movement

## The Fix

### 1. Made Transform the Source of Truth

Changed boid movement to update Transform:
```rust
// Before - updating Position directly
fn move_boids(mut boids: Query<(&mut Position, &Velocity), With<Boid>>) {
    pos.0.x += vel.0.x * delta;
}

// After - updating Transform (physics)
fn move_boids(mut boids: Query<(&mut Transform, &Velocity), With<Boid>>) {
    transform.translation.x += vel.0.x * delta;
}
```

### 2. Added Initial Position Sync

Ensured Position matches Transform when entities spawn:
```rust
pub fn initial_position_sync(
    mut query: Query<(&Transform, &mut Position), Added<SyncPosition>>,
) {
    for (transform, mut position) in query.iter_mut() {
        position.0 = transform.translation.truncate();
    }
}
```

### 3. Removed Conflicting Systems

- Removed `move_players` function - physics handles player movement
- Ensured single source of truth for position updates

### 4. Enabled Auto-Correction

Set `auto_correct_drift: true` to automatically fix any drift that occurs.

## Result

✅ No more drift warnings
✅ Positions stay synchronized
✅ Clean separation: Physics owns Transform, sync system copies to Position

## Lessons Learned

1. **Be explicit about ownership** - Physics should own position through Transform
2. **Initial sync is critical** - Don't assume components start in sync
3. **Avoid duplicate systems** - One system should own each piece of state
4. **Trust the architecture** - Let physics handle physics, networking handle networking
