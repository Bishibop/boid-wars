# Boid Wars Asset Strategy

## Overview

Boid Wars requires visual assets for a multiplayer twin-stick bullet-hell space shooter with 10,000+ AI-controlled enemies (boids). This document summarizes our research findings and presents the top three asset options.

## Asset Requirements

### Visual Assets Needed
- **Player Ships**: 8 unique designs for different player types
- **Enemy Boids**: 
  - Swarmer sprites (basic enemies)
  - Shooter sprites (ranged attackers)
  - Elite sprites (tougher enemies)
  - Boss sprites (major threats)
- **Projectiles**: Player bullets, enemy bullets, special attacks
- **Effects**: Explosions, trails, impacts, shields
- **UI Elements**: HUD, menus, health bars, minimap
- **Backgrounds**: Space environments

### Technical Requirements
- **Pixi.js Compatible**: Sprite sheets with JSON metadata
- **Performance Optimized**: Texture atlases for instanced rendering
- **Scalable**: Multiple resolutions for LOD system
- **Tintable**: Base sprites that can be colored dynamically

## Key Findings

### Envato Elements Assets
- **Available**: Space Shooter Creation Kit series, enemy sprites, effects
- **Format**: Vector files (AI/EPS), individual PNGs, layered PSDs
- **NOT Included**: Pre-made sprite sheets or JSON metadata
- **Extra Work Required**: Must export vectors and create texture atlases

### Pixi.js Integration
- Requires sprite sheets with JSON metadata
- Best performance with texture atlases
- Supports dynamic tinting for color variations
- ParticleContainer can handle 10,000+ sprites

## Top 3 Asset Options

### Option 1: Envato Elements + TexturePacker
**Since you have access to Envato Elements**

**Assets**:
- Space Shooter Creation Kit 3 (51 components, 4 colors, 19 pre-made ships)
- Enemy SpaceShip 2D Sprites (6 designs with animations)
- Explosion packs and effects

**Workflow**:
1. Download vector assets from Envato
2. Export to PNG at multiple resolutions
3. Use TexturePacker to create Pixi-compatible atlases
4. Generate JSON metadata with PixiJS preset

**Pros**:
- Professional quality vectors
- Unlimited customization
- Already paid for (company subscription)
- Export at any resolution
- Consistent art style

**Cons**:
- 1-2 days of asset preparation work
- Need TexturePacker license ($50)
- Must organize hundreds of files
- Learning curve for asset pipeline

**Time Estimate**: 8-16 hours total setup

---

### Option 2: Kenney's Space Shooter Redux (Free)
**Best free option with minimal setup**

**Assets**:
- 295+ sprites including ships, enemies, bullets, effects
- XML data (convertible to JSON)
- Consistent art style
- CC0 license (completely free)

**Workflow**:
1. Download free pack from kenney.nl
2. Run through TexturePacker or free alternative
3. Import directly to Pixi.js

**Pros**:
- Completely free
- High quality, game-ready
- Includes everything needed
- Fast implementation (2-4 hours)
- Well-organized files

**Cons**:
- Less customization than vectors
- Fixed art style
- May look "generic" (widely used)
- Limited to provided variations

**Time Estimate**: 2-4 hours total setup

---

### Option 3: CraftPix Premium Packs
**Middle ground - some assembly required**

**Assets**:
- Space shooter packs ($20-40)
- Often includes sprite sheets
- Sometimes has JSON data
- Various art styles available

**Workflow**:
1. Purchase specific pack
2. Verify JSON compatibility
3. Minor adjustments if needed
4. Import to Pixi.js

**Pros**:
- More unique than free assets
- Often game-ready formats
- Good quality/price ratio
- Some include animations

**Cons**:
- Additional cost
- Quality varies by pack
- May need format conversion
- Less flexible than vectors

**Time Estimate**: 4-8 hours total setup

## Recommended Approach

Given that you have Envato Elements access, we recommend:

### Primary Strategy: Envato + TexturePacker
1. **Use Envato Elements** for main assets (you're already paying for it)
2. **Buy TexturePacker** ($50 one-time) for asset pipeline
3. **Supplement with Kenney** for quick prototyping or missing pieces

### Implementation Plan
```
Week 1:
- Download Space Shooter Creation Kit 3
- Set up TexturePacker pipeline
- Export core enemy types (swarmer, shooter, elite)
- Create first texture atlas

Week 2:
- Add effects and projectiles
- Implement LOD variations
- Optimize texture atlases
- Test performance with 10k sprites
```

### Asset Pipeline
```
Envato Vectors → PNG Export → TexturePacker → Pixi.js
     ↓              ↓              ↓            ↓
  (AI/EPS)    (Multiple Res)  (Atlas+JSON)  (Ready!)
```

## Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Texture Atlas Limits**: Keep under 2048x2048 for compatibility
2. **Trim Transparent Pixels**: Reduces memory usage
3. **Pack Similar Sprites**: Group by usage pattern
4. **Use Pixi's Tinting**: One sprite, many colors
5. **Implement LOD**: Distant boids use simpler sprites

## Quick Start Checklist

- [ ] Download Space Shooter Creation Kit 3 from Envato
- [ ] Install TexturePacker (free trial available)
- [ ] Export 5-10 enemy sprites as test
- [ ] Create first texture atlas with PixiJS preset
- [ ] Test loading in Pixi.js with ParticleContainer
- [ ] Verify tinting works for color variations
- [ ] Scale test with 1000+ sprites

## Conclusion

While Envato Elements doesn't provide ready-made sprite sheets, the vector quality and your existing subscription make it the best choice. The extra day of setup work is worth it for customizable, professional assets. Use TexturePacker to bridge the gap between Envato's artist-friendly formats and Pixi's performance-optimized requirements.
